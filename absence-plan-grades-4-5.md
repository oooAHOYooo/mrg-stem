# Mr. Gonzalez's STEM Classroom Absence Plan

**Grades:** 4–5  
**School:** Barnum

**Lesson:** STEM Lesson 0 – Introduction to Class Expectations & City & Bridge Building

---

## 🎯 Warmup Activity

Ask each student:
- Their name
- An invention idea to make school more fun or easier
- What problem it solves

Encourage wild and silly ideas!

## 🌉 Bridge Time

### Goal: Build bridges with bricks that connect between tables

**Setup:**
- Students work in small groups (2-3 students per table)
- Each table builds a small city section using bricks
- Challenge: Create bridges that connect your city to neighboring tables

**Timer: Set for 25-30 minutes**

**Tips for Building Strong Bridges:**
- **Foundation First:** Make sure your bridge has a solid base on both tables
- **Support Structures:** Use columns or arches to hold up the middle of long bridges
- **Balance:** Distribute weight evenly across the bridge
- **Test as You Build:** Gently test your bridge's stability as you add pieces
- **Work Together:** Coordinate with neighboring tables to connect your bridges
- **Types to Try:** Suspension (hanging), arch (curved), beam (straight), or truss (triangular supports)
- **Start Simple:** Build a basic bridge first, then add details and decorations

**Materials Needed:**
- Building bricks/blocks (LEGO, Mega Bloks, or similar)
- Small objects to test bridge stability (optional)

## 💻 Digital Option (Computer Activity)

Students who prefer digital building or finish early can:

**Option 1: Scratch**
- Create a city scene or bridge animation
- Design a game where characters move through a city
- Build a virtual bridge that characters can cross
- Use sprites to represent buildings, bridges, and city elements

**Option 2: Tinkercad**
- Design 3D models of buildings or bridges
- Create a cityscape with multiple structures
- Design a bridge that could be 3D printed
- Experiment with different architectural styles

**Computer Setup:**
- Ensure computers are available for students who want this option
- Provide access to Scratch (scratch.mit.edu) or Tinkercad (tinkercad.com)
- Students can work individually or in pairs on computers

---

## 👥 Review

**After the timer goes off:**
- Students pair up or form small groups
- Share and explain their bridges
- Discuss:
  - How their bridge connects to other tables
  - What type of bridge they built (suspension, arch, beam, truss)
  - Challenges they faced and how they solved them
  - What makes their bridge strong and stable
- If using digital tools, share their Scratch projects or Tinkercad designs
- Celebrate creativity and collaboration

---

## 🧹 Clean-Up

- Return all bricks to their proper storage containers
- Disassemble bridges carefully (save designs if possible)
- Ensure all digital work is saved with student names
- Return computers to their proper places
- Wipe down tables and ensure workspace is tidy

---

## 🧭 Expectations

- Listen respectfully
- Be patient and kind
- Think creatively
- Share ideas
- Collaborate with classmates
- Clean up after activities
- Use technology responsibly (if using computers)

## 📝 Notes for Substitute Teacher

- **Timer:** Set a visible timer for 25-30 minutes during Bridge Time. Give 5-minute and 1-minute warnings
- **Flexibility:** Some students may prefer physical building, others digital. Both are valid!
- **Collaboration:** Encourage students to work together, especially when building bridges between tables
- **Safety:** Remind students to be careful when reaching across tables to connect bridges
- **Storage:** If students want to save their physical builds, take photos or allow them to label their creations
